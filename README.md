## Description Of The Project

Shape Up mobile app, created in Android studio with the help of dart language and flutter sdk, is a gym app which helps its users to get in shape and to maintain a healthy lifestyle. It can display 5 different screens which are home_page, aerobic, strength, balance and flexibility classes. From home_page class we can navigate to other 4 classes. For simulation of the project an AVD manager tool(Pixel 3 XL API 30) is used.

### This is how the main page looks;
